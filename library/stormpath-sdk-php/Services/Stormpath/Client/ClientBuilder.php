/**
 * A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern">Builder design pattern</a> implementation used to
 * construct {@link Services_Stormpath_Client_Client} instances.
 * <p/>
 * The ClientBuilder is especially useful for constructing Services_Stormpath_Client_ClientBuilder
 * instances with Stormpath API Key information loaded from an external {@code .yml} file (or YAML loadable string)
 * to ensure the API Key secret (password) does not reside in plaintext in code.
 * <p/>
 * Example usage:
 * <code>
 * $location = '/home/jsmith/.stormpath/apiKey.yml';
 *
 * $clientBuilder = new Services_Stormpath_Client_ClientBuilder;
 * $client = $clientBuilder->setApiKeyFileLocation($location)->build();
 * </code>
 * <p/>
 * You may load files from the filesystem or URLs by specifying the file location.
 *
 * @see setApiKeyFileLocation() for more information.

class Services_Stormpath_Client_ClientBuilder
{
    private $apiKeyIdPropertyName = "apiKey.id";

    private $apiKeyFileLocation;
    private $baseURL;

    /**
     * Sets the location of the YAML file to load containing the API Key (Id and secret) used by the
     * Client to communicate with the Stormpath REST API.
     * <p/>
     * You may load files from the filesystem, or URLs just specifying the file location.
     * <h3>File Contents</h3>
     * <p/>
     * When the file is loaded, the following name/value pairs are expected to be present by default:
     * <table>
     *     <tr>
     *         <th>Key</th>
     *         <th>Value</th>
     *     </tr>
     *     <tr>
     *         <td>apiKey.id</td>
     *         <td>An individual account's API Key ID</td>
     *     </tr>
     *     <tr>
     *         <td>apiKey.secret</td>
     *         <td>The API Key Secret (password) that verifies the paired API Key ID.</td>
     *     </tr>
     * </table>
     * <p/>
     * Assuming you were using these default property names, your {@code ClientBuilder} usage might look like the
     * following:
     * <pre>
     * $location = "/home/jsmith/.stormpath/apiKey.yml";
     *
     * $clientBuilder = new Services_Stormpath_Client_ClientBuilder;
     * $client = $clientBuilder->setApiKeyFileLocation($location)->build();
     *
     * </pre>
     * <h3>Custom Property Names</h3>
     * If you want to control the property names used in the file, you may configure them via
     * {@link setApiKeyIdPropertyName} and
     * {@link setApiKeySecretPropertyName}.
     * <p/>
     * For example, if you had a {@code /home/jsmith/.stormpath/apiKey.yml} file with the following
     * name/value pairs:
     * <pre>
     * $myStormpathApiKeyId = 'foo'
     * $myStormpathApiKeySecret = 'mySuperSecretValue'
     * </pre>
     * Your {@code ClientBuilder} usage would look like the following:
     * <pre>
     * $location = "/home/jsmith/.stormpath/apiKey.yml";
     *
     * $clientBuilder = new Services_Stormpath_Client_ClientBuilder;
     * $client = $clientBuilder->setApiKeyFileLocation($location)
     *                         ->setApiKeyIdPropertyName($myStormpathApiKeyId)
     *                         ->setApiKeySecretPropertyName($myStormpathApiKeySecret)
     *                         ->build();
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param location the file or url location of the API Key {@code .yml} file to load when
     *                 constructing the API Key to use for communicating with the Stormpath REST API.
     *
     * @return the Services_Stormpath_Client_ClientBuilder instance for method chaining.
